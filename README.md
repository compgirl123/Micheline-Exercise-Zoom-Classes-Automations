# Micheline Zumba Automation Project

The purpose of creating this automation project was to for the easier coordination between clients and employees for the bi-weekly classes offered by Micheline
virtually on Zoom. The creation of this automation utilizes the Zoom Api as well as Google Sheets. 

The project is divided into 2 main steps:

1. Email automation
2. Recording Automation

We also plan on creating a cancellation notice email that will notify all clients should there be a cancellation
